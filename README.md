# Project Overview

Welcome to the eCommerce Platform project, a fully functional online shopping application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

This project simulates an online store where users can browse products, manage their cart, and place orders.

The admin panel allows easy management of products, orders, and user accounts.

This application is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience, from browsing products to managing payments.

The integration with Stripe for payments, combined with a JWT-based authentication system, ensures both a smooth and secure user experience.
